                <h1>The Challenge</h1>
                <p>The goal is elegantly simple yet deceptively complex: 
                    <b>place N chess queens on an N×N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other.</b> 
                    This challenge tests your strategic thinking and pattern recognition skills. 
                    As the board size increases, the puzzle becomes exponentially more difficult. 
                    For example, while an 8×8 board has 92 solutions, a 12×12 board has 14,200,000 solutions! 
                </p>

                <h2>How to Use</h2>
                <p> 1. Adjust the board size using the slider.<br>
                    2. Click on a cell to place or remove a queen.<br>
                    3. Unsafe queen positions will be highlighted in red.<br>
                    4. Click <b>Solve</b> to find a solution automatically.<br>
                    5. Use <b>Reset</b> to clear the board.<br>
                    6. Toggle between themes with the theme button.</p>

            <h2>About the Problem</h2>
            <p>The N-Queen problem is a classic puzzle in computer science and mathematics. The challenge is to place N chess queens on an N×N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. In chess, a queen can attack any piece in the same row, column, or diagonal.</p>
            <p>For a standard 8×8 chessboard, the goal is to place 8 queens safely. However, the problem can be generalized to any N×N board. As the board size increases, the number of possible arrangements grows exponentially, making it an excellent example of combinatorial complexity.</p>
            <h2>How to Solve</h2>
            <h3>Using Backtracking Algorithm</h3>

            <p>Backtracking is an algorithmic technique for solving problems recursively by trying to build a solution incrementally, one piece at a time. If at any point it determines that the current solution cannot be completed, it "backtracks" to the previous step and tries a different path.</p>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Start:</strong> Begin with an empty board.</li>
                <li><strong>Place:</strong> Try placing a queen in the first available position in the current row.</li>
                <li><strong>Check:</strong> If the placement is safe (no conflicts with other queens), move to the next row.</li>
                <li><strong>Recurse:</strong> Repeat steps 2-3 for the next row.</li>
                <li><strong>Backtrack:</strong> If a safe position can't be found, or if we've placed all queens successfully, backtrack to the previous row and try the next position.</li>
                <li><strong>Repeat:</strong> Continue this process until a solution is found or all possibilities are exhausted.</li>
            </ol>
            <h2>Why N-Queen Matters</h2>
            <p>The N-Queen problem is more than just a puzzle:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Algorithm Design:</strong> It's an excellent example for teaching recursive problem-solving and backtracking.</li>
                <li><strong>Optimization:</strong> Solving N-Queen efficiently requires optimizing the algorithm, making it a benchmark for algorithm performance.</li>
                <li><strong>Real-world Applications:</strong> The principles used in solving N-Queen apply to various real-world problems, including resource allocation, scheduling, and constraint satisfaction problems.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Complexity and Challenges</h2>
            <p>For an N×N board, there are N^N possible arrangements of queens.
                However, only a tiny fraction of these are solutions.
                As N increases, the problem becomes exponentially more difficult.
                The largest known solution has been found for N=27, requiring significant computational power.</p>

                    <h2>About the Developer</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I'm Raunak, a passionate developer with a deep interest in algorithms and problem-solving. My journey with the N-Queens problem started in primary school when my cousin challenged me to place 8 queens on a chessboard without them threatening each other. That early fascination grew as I advanced in computer science, where I discovered the backtracking algorithm, which finally provided the solution to the puzzle that had intrigued me for years. This N-Queens Solver project is the result of that fascination, showcasing the elegance of backtracking and the complexity of combinatorial problems.</p>
                    <p>Beyond this project, I focus on developing software and web applications that solve complex problems. My skills range from algorithm design to UI/UX interfaces, and I particularly enjoy projects that combine logical challenges with visual elements, much like the N-Queens Solver. For more such projects, feel free to explore my website and GitHub.</p>
